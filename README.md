## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is my own personal automation system designed to help quickly build and configure [macOS](https://www.apple.com/osx/) installations. It can easily be modified to work with other [*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phmullins/bootstrap.git
```

You'll probably want to edit the `brewfile` as I'm sure you don't want everything installed on your system that I have installed on mine. Once you've done that you should run:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh 
```
to stand up a custom macOS system.
