## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is my own personal automation system designed to help quickly build and configure [macOS](https://www.apple.com/osx/) installations. It can easily be modified to work with other [*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems.

## Installation
Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/phmullins/bootstrap.git`

## Usage
After cloning, simply run ./bootstrap.sh to stand up a macOS system
